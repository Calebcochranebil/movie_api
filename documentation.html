        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
            The objective of this application is to develop the server-side
            infrastructure for a web-based "movies" application, which will give
            users a comprehensive insight into diverse movies, directors, and
            genres. Alongside user authentication and profile maintenance
            capabilities, the application shall empower users to curate a
            catalog of their preferred movies.
